# StrangeEons3-LRL

This repository contains the work-in-progress version of "The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" plugin for Strange Eons.

Status: Code available here is a big rewrite of the plugin. This version is NOT functional (for now). It may include a good amount of bugs, and needs deep testing and will surely have problems loading components from previous versions, like the current stable version available in the Strange Eons repository.

One of the main goals of this rewrite, is providing to anyone interested an example of a complex plugin that may serve as the base for their project. Not all files are fully commented, but the files used for the Ally card should be used as reference, as they provide comments on stuff seen on the other game components (https://github.com/HeavyKaragh/StrangeEons3-LRL/blob/master/TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/resources/TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/Ally/component.js).

An overview of the plug-in is available in https://github.com/HeavyKaragh/StrangeEons3-LRL/blob/master/TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/resources/TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/Readme-UpdatingThePlugin.html
