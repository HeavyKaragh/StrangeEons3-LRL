/*
All the plug-in code revolves around the concept of the component "settings"
explained in the Strange Eons developer manual. "Settings" (defined in the
code by the $ symbol) store everything the user can define in a component,
like it's title, stats or portraits placement.
I've written a library that creates user interface controls, drawing methods
and other stuff based on the "setting" name. Basically, three functions are
needed for each editable part on a component: one for user interface control
(it's a short text or a paragraph or a image?), one for the painter (if it's text
, which font and size?) and another that actually paints it (where and when? to
avoid overlapping other stuff and/or to use a special graphical effect).
For example, card's "Type" text setting, ($Type), is defined in createInterface
by Type_control, in the createFrontPainter by Type_writer and in the
paintFront by writeLine('Type').

    part uses it's own formats to add italics or whatever it needs,
